# Alignments computation 

In this project different alignment computation technique based on A-star search and split-point-based search are implemented, which are listed as follows:
1. regular astar algorithm.
2. split-point-based algorithm.
3. split-point-based algorithm + caching strategy.
4. split-point-based algorithm + caching strategy + reopen method.
5. split-point-based algorithm + counter settings.
